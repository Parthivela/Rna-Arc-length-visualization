# Rna-Arc-length-visualization
This project simulates and visualizes the 3D path of a single-stranded RNA sequence inspired by SARS-CoV-2 using parametric equations. It calculates the arc length of the RNA strand by numerically estimating the total distance along the curve in 3D space.  The plot represents how such molecular structures might curve or twist over time or space. The project uses Python's scientific computing libraries to calculate and visualize the data with an interactive 3D plot generated using Plotly.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- Defines a 3D parametric curve:  
  \( x(t) = 2 \sqrt{1 - \cos(2t)} \)  
  \( y(t) = \sqrt{8} \cos(t) \)  
  \( z(t) = t \)  
- Computes the **arc length** numerically using Euclidean distance between adjacent 3D points.
- Visualizes the RNA-like structure using **interactive Plotly 3D plots**.



## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
